# AI Usage Transparency

- The assignment explicitly permits AI tools but requires documentation.
- **Requirement**: If I ask you to generate complex logic, you must succinctly summarize the "methodology" or approach used in the response so I can copy it to the README.
- **Prompts**: Keep track of major prompts used if requested, as these must be submitted.

# Delivery

- The final README must include:
  1. Setup instructions.
  2. Technical choices explanations (why you chose certain approaches).
  3. Known limitations or improvements.
  4. Public URL for the deployed app.
